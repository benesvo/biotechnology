scripts for yeast cultivation simulation and control

During cultivation of yeast biomass for wine or beer fermentation, strict regulation of process parameters (pO2, feeding, ...) 
is essential for achieving maximum yield and biomass quality (primarily viability, vitality and durability). Scripts in this repository 
represent support for cultivation process in the "CVMB" of EPS biotechnology - they are designed to simulate optimal growth 
of Saccharomyces biomass and calculate corresponding process parameters based on initial OD of inoculum.  
In the future, scripts for other microbial species (non-saccharomyces yeast, filamentous fungi, bacteria) may be present.
